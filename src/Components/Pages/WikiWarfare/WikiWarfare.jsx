// WikiWarfare are typing games set up for the Wikipedia API, one can be
// typing through an article just to set record time, one could be a campaign
// with boss like system (desc in cross puzzle) where linked articles come in with their own blurbs.
// one can just be wandering through wikipedia artilces, where if the user sees a link they can decide to 
// go into that article, and then if they finish it they come back out and pick up where they left off maybe. 
// wikipedia race to get to a certain topic from a certain topic, but they have to type all of the words
// up to a link to access that link. just some ideas.
