// TypeFight is the classic set of games where players can test their typing speed,
// type through enemies kind of like qwerty, and hopeful play against their friend (main priority)
// could have a couple game types like one where you are magicians and type up complicated spells
// then opponent has chance to type a word to kill the spell or just keep working on their own 
// or just typing lowers opponent health or makes your car / ship go further or runner goes faster
// and if you miss type runner trips and has a small delay, etc.
