// PainTrain is a fight against an AI aka pAIn trAIn where somehow the user will interact with 
// a chatGPT like, the AI will spit out it's text and the user has to type everything it says before
// time is up. Maybe the user has to engineer prompts to get it to say less, like have a partially 
// written prompt where the user can only alter one word like "give me the complete history of ____"
// then has to type whatever is returned in 1 minute idk.
