A killer snail chases the players' characters. The players have to click a location for their players to move to, 
and the snails move directly there slowly. The goal is to be the last person alive and survive as long as possible. 
The map may be a maze and words have to be typed to clear walls (that either keep appearing or the screen scrolls). 
Requires the users to quickly click and type and strategically pick locations. Would prefer it to be cooperative with the 
number of snails equal to the number of players and maybe with revives. Could also be competitve and dead players could place
obstacles or something. Maybe the words themselves make up the maze like a crossword puzzle you try to run through, and so users have 
to type words to destroy them so they can go a direction that they want to, while the snails can move directly as the crow flies. 
Or players could be like underground mining and need to type words for "energy" to move but more and more un-minable rocks start to show up 
so players have to move in weird round-about ways. Or finally, players have avatars that move on their own and they simply pick a route for 
the avatar and type to clear words off of that route. 

OR THIS MIGHT BE IT!!!, you click where you want your person to go through the maze but 
they can't go through walls, and you have to type to move them so the faster you type the fater they go with a funny walk like steppy feet.
The maze may have extra walls pop up, or may just shrink slowly, or the snails could just get faster or there could be time to actually 
"win" based on a difficulty selected (which could also change the maze). so player clicks where they want to go in the maze and then types
to "move" their player. To make it smart the player could navigate the maze, to make it hard they can only move in a straight line and stop 
if they hit a maze edge, which may be more do-able.
